Temperature Prediction of Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor using Random forest, KNN, Neural Network and linear regression
I am able to predict the temperatures of motors using the machine learning algorithms, by far Random forest, KNN and Neural network(parameter tuned) are able to yield good scores, but there is always room for more improvement of prediction. The neural networks used here if tuned well with adding more parameters might give better result than
what we had now. we also need some domain knowledge to add up more features or merge features in order to see more insights of the data presented. More advancements in motors can increase the capability of machine learning
algorithms to predict better. Moreover, findings of all the researches on this topic should be examined to find what it leads to make the predictions better, the studies on this motors are crucial because the autonomous cars
are booming and they are the future of auto industry.The performance and reliability of machine learning algorithms especially supervised learning algorithms are yet to beimproved to their fullest forms and they tend to do more
with upcoming updates
